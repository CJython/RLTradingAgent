# NaN Error Fix Summary

## Problem
The RL Trading Agent was experiencing NaN (Not a Number) errors during model inference, specifically:
```
Prediction error: Expected parameter loc (Tensor of shape (1, 1)) of distribution Normal(loc: tensor([[nan]], device='cuda:0'), scale: tensor([[0.7416]], device='cuda:0')) to satisfy the constraint Real(), but found invalid values: tensor([[nan]], device='cuda:0')
```

## Root Cause
The issue occurred when:
1. Yahoo Finance API rate limiting prevented real data downloads
2. Fallback dummy data contained constant values (all prices = 100.0)
3. Technical indicators calculated on constant data produced NaN values
4. NaN values in observations caused the PPO model to output NaN predictions

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Dummy Data Generation (`src/envs/SingleStockTradingEnv.py`)
- **Before**: Constant values (open=100, high=105, low=95, close=100)
- **After**: Realistic price movements with:
  - Random walk with 2% daily volatility
  - Proper OHLC relationships (high ≥ max(open,close), low ≤ min(open,close))
  - Variable volume data
  - Reproducible with seed=42

### 2. Comprehensive NaN Handling in Data Processing
- Added NaN detection after technical indicator calculation
- Forward-fill and backward-fill for missing values
- Default value assignment for remaining NaNs:
  - Technical indicators (MACD, RSI, CCI, DX): 0
  - Price-based indicators (Bollinger bands, SMA): mean close price
  - Turbulence: 0

### 3. Observation Validation in Inference (`src/inference/inference.py`)
- Added NaN checks before model predictions
- Replace NaN values with zeros using `np.nan_to_num()`
- Fallback to safe "hold" action if prediction fails
- Enhanced error handling in batch predictions with step limits

### 4. User Interface Improvements (`streamlit_app.py`)
- Capture output from environment creation
- Display warnings when dummy data is used
- Inform users about API rate limiting issues

## Files Modified
1. `src/envs/SingleStockTradingEnv.py` - Enhanced dummy data generation and NaN handling
2. `src/inference/inference.py` - Added observation validation and error handling
3. `streamlit_app.py` - Added user warnings for dummy data usage

## Results
- ✅ NaN errors eliminated
- ✅ Model successfully generates predictions with dummy data
- ✅ Technical indicators calculate properly on realistic dummy data
- ✅ App provides user feedback about data quality
- ✅ Robust error handling prevents crashes

## Testing Verified
- App loads without errors
- Model predictions work with both real and dummy data
- Technical indicators calculate correctly
- User interface shows appropriate warnings
- No infinite loops or crashes during inference

This fix ensures the RL Trading Agent works reliably even when real market data is unavailable due to API limitations.
